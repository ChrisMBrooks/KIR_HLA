1. Reverse Regression - ElasticNet for Feature Importance 
2. Reverse RandomForest for Feature Importance 
3. What is the overlap? How significant are the top features? 
4. Co-variance analysis - Are there any collinear features we missed out on? Do they seem sensible? 
5. Perform OLS for the most important features, get Bonferroni corrected p-scores, 
compute prediction against test data-set, do we care about prediction or do we want to look at p-scores
to ensure they are commensurate?

6. Can we leverage the fact that there's twins data? heredity? 
Can we leverage the fact that there's multiple time points in the twins data?


Random Forest better deals with non-linear relationships 


Is Random Forest equipped for Sparse Data?
RF does not fit very well on this type of problem -- bagging and suboptimal selection of splits may waste most of the model insight on zero-only areas
