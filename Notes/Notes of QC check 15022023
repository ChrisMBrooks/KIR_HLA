Summary for the Day 15022023

Spent the day cross checking Laura's code with mine. Two discrepancies were found. 
Motif identification matched up for hla_c_c1, hla_c_c2, hla_b_bw4, but not for hla_b_46_c1 & hla_b_73_c1

You identified all c1 motifs on betas not just b46 and b73. 

“Residues 77e80 characterize the C1 (S, L, R, N) and C2 (N, L, R, K) motifs of HLA-C and some HLA-B allotype” - Source

The key is 'some'

Ask Becca what to do next. Do we scarp this part of the code and /or make it more specfic?
